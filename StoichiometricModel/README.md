# ProStoichiometric Energy-Scaled Metabolic Modeling  
A Protein-Abundance Weighted, ATP-Scaled Stoichiometric Model for Estimating Species-Specific Energy Contributions in Microbial Communities  
## Define Key Metabolic Reactions for Each Species  
* Compile a set of overall metabolic reactions for each microbial species based on their known metabolic capabilities.
* Sources: KEGG, MetaCyc, and scientific literature.  
## Associate Each Reaction with ATP Yield  
* Assign an ATP yield to each reaction as a proxy for energy conservation efficiency.
* ATP values sourced from existing metabolic databases and literature.
## Measure Community Metabolite Levels  
* Use metabolomic data from synthetic microbial communities to determine concentrations of key metabolites.
## Collect Metaproteomic Data  
* Identify marker proteins corresponding to each metabolic reaction via metaproteomics.
* Quantify the relative abundances of these proteins to infer which species are active in each pathway.
