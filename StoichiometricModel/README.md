# ProStoichiometric Energy-Scaled Metabolic Modeling  
A Protein-Abundance Weighted, ATP-Scaled Stoichiometric Model for Estimating Species-Specific Energy Contributions in Microbial Communities  
## Define Key Metabolic Reactions for Each Species  
* Compile a set of overall metabolic reactions for each microbial species based on their known metabolic capabilities.
* Sources: KEGG, MetaCyc, and scientific literature.
